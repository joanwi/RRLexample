<p>When writing a psychology literature review, you should emphasize theories and frameworks related to your topic.</p>
<p>If your focus is on <strong>self-esteem</strong> and <strong>body image</strong> among adolescents, consider including theories such as <strong>Cognitive Behavioral Theory</strong>. You can reference studies that show how media portrayals affect body image and self-perception.</p>
<p>This could involve discussing research where participants who viewed traditional media showed decreased self-esteem compared to those exposed to more empowering representations.</p>
<p>By weaving these threads, you create a strong narrative in your review.</p>
<h3>Science Literature Review Example</h3>
<p>A science literature review should highlight empirical studies relevant to your topic. For example, if your topic revolves around <strong>e-learning</strong>, discuss studies that investigate its effectiveness in improving educational outcomes.</p>
<p>You might reference research indicating that students who engage in online learning modalities exhibit higher engagement levels. Additionally, studies showing how mindfulness techniques can be integrated into e-learning environments could enhance focus and mitigate stress.</p>
<p>These findings establish a solid research foundation for your study.</p>
<h3>Mini Literature Review Example</h3>
<p>A mini literature review condenses key findings and themes into a brief overview. If you are focusing on <strong>mental health</strong> and <strong>social media</strong>, you might summarize existing studies that examine the connection between excessive social media use and rising anxiety levels.</p>
<p>Organizing your findings into bullet points can enhance clarity:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Increased screen time</strong> correlates with higher anxiety rates.</li>
<li>Social media often portrays unrealistic standards, affecting self-esteem.</li>
<li>Engagement in mindfulness practices may help reduce anxiety.</li>
</ul>
<p>This concise format helps convey important information quickly and effectively without overwhelming the reader.</p>
